## Machine Learning & Statistics - Supplemental Course Material 2021
### Topic: [``scikit-learn``](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SeanOhAileasa/mls-scikit-learn/blob/main/mls-scikit-learn.ipynb)

Supplemental course material for the ``Machine Learning & Statistics`` module (5 Credits) of the ``Higher Diploma in Science in Computing (Data Analytics) (H.Dip)`` programme (75 Credits) at **Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology (GMIT)**.

## Topic Roadmap

- Official ``scikit-learn`` tutorial.

## Prerequisites

- Require Python to be loaded on your local machine. Recommend downloading and installing Anaconda.

https://www.anaconda.com/download/

## Execute Jupyter Notebook

- The software must be downloaded and run on a machine as follows:

	- Clone the repository with the following command:

	``git clone https://github.com/SeanOhAileasa/mls-scikit-learn.git``

    - Run Jupyter Notebooks from the command line with the following:

	``jupyter notebook``

    - Open notebook - ``mls-scikit-learn.ipynb``

    - Once running within the Jupyter environment can navigate with ease - links are plentiful.

	- ***Notebook links will not work on github given that github renders as static HTML - also not able to view equation tag numbers. Please run on a local machine or use nbviewer (see below).***

- An alternative to downloading and running on a local machine with all features included (links/equation tag number etc) can view via [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SeanOhAileasa/mls-scikit-learn/blob/main/mls-scikit-learn.ipynb).
